    <h1>Terms of Service for eaZSt</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 20, 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the <strong>eaZSt</strong> mobile application (the "App") operated by <strong>FRANCIS CACCAVALE</strong> ("us," "we," or "our").</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the App</h2>
    <p><strong>eaZSt</strong> is a visualization tool designed to help you track and view your income sources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Informational Use Only:</strong> The financial data presented in the App is for informational and entertainment purposes only. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee that the data retrieved from third-party APIs (YouTube, Twitch, etc.) is 100% accurate or up-to-date.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Financial Advice:</strong> The App does not provide financial, tax, or legal advice. You should verify all financial data with your actual bank or platform records before making financial decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>The App offers a "Pro Mode" subscription that unlocks additional features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Payments are processed securely via the Google Play Store. We do not store your credit card information.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellations:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play Store account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> All refund requests must be handled directly through Google Play’s refund policy. We do not have the ability to issue direct refunds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content (including the particle physics engine, visual design, and logo) are and will remain the exclusive property of <strong>FRANCIS CACCAVALE</strong>. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</p>

    <h2>4. User Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the App is described in our <a href="https://frncscccvl.github.io/eaZSt-web/privacy/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> You understand that your financial data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for keeping your device secure to prevent unauthorized access to your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by us (e.g., YouTube, Twitch, Patreon). We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall <strong>FRANCIS CACCAVALE</strong>, nor his partners or suppliers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any errors or inaccuracies of content.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
