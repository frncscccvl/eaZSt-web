Privacy Policy for eaZSt
Last Updated: January 25, 2026

eaZSt ("the App") is developed by FRANCIS CACCAVALE ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

1. Data Architecture (Hybrid Model)
eaZSt prioritizes on-device storage for most activities, but utilizes a secure backend server for specific banking integrations where required by security protocols.

Platform Integrations (YouTube, Twitch, Patreon): Authentication tokens and data for these platforms are stored locally on your device using secure encryption (iOS Keychain and Android Keystore). We do not sync this data to our servers.

Banking Integrations (Plaid): Due to strict banking security requirements, authentication tokens for bank connections are stored in an encrypted database on our secure backend server.

2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
A. Third-Party Service Connections (OAuth)
The App allows you to connect to third-party services to visualize your earnings.

Direct Integrations: For services like YouTube and Twitch, the App communicates directly from your device to the service provider. We do not intercept or store this data on our servers.

Banking Services (Plaid): We use Plaid Inc. ("Plaid") to connect your bank accounts. When you link a bank account:

Plaid collects your login credentials directly (we never see your bank username or password).

Plaid provides our secure server with an Access Token.

We use this token to fetch transaction data (specifically deposits) to calculate your passive income.

Information collected by Plaid is subject to the Plaid Privacy Policy.

B. Biometric Data (FaceID / TouchID)
The App uses your device's biometric capabilities to secure your "Vault" of financial data.

Processing: Biometric authentication is handled entirely by your device's operating system.

No Access: The App never has access to your actual face data or fingerprint data. We only receive a "Pass" or "Fail" signal from the operating system.

C. Crash Logs and Stability (Firebase)
We use Google Firebase Crashlytics to help us identify crashes and fix bugs.

Data Collected: Anonymous crash reports containing technical details.

Privacy: This data is anonymous and does not contain your financial tokens or personal identity.

3. Data Retention & Deletion
Local Data: For Platform Integrations (YouTube, etc.), uninstalling the App permanently deletes the data from your device.

Server Data (Banking): If you choose to disconnect a bank account inside the App, we immediately delete the associated Access Token from our server database, permanently severing the connection to your bank.

Requesting Full Deletion: You may request the deletion of all server-side data associated with your user ID by contacting us at the email below.

4. Third-Party Links
The App contains links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.

5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.

6. Your Consent
By using the App, you consent to our Privacy Policy.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
