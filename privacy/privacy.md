Privacy Policy for eaZSt
Last Updated: December 26, 2025

eaZSt ("the App") is developed by Francis Caccavale ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the eaZSt mobile application and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

1. The "Local-First" Data Philosophy
eaZSt is designed to be privacy-first. Unlike most financial apps, we do not run a backend server to store your personal financial data.

Financial Data: Your earnings data, access tokens (OAuth), and account balances are stored locally on your device using secure encryption (iOS Keychain and Android Keystore).

No Cloud Sync: We do not sync your financial credentials to any cloud database. If you delete the App, this data is permanently erased from your device.

2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
A. Third-Party Service Connections (OAuth)
The App allows you to connect to third-party services (YouTube, Twitch, Patreon) to visualize your earnings.

How it works: We use standard OAuth 2.0 protocols to authenticate with these services.

Data Access: When you connect a service, the App receives an Access Token and Refresh Token.

Storage: These tokens are stored securely on your device. We do not transmit these tokens to any external server other than the respective service provider (e.g., sending a token to YouTube to fetch your revenue).

B. Biometric Data (FaceID / TouchID)
The App uses your device's biometric capabilities (FaceID on iOS, Android Facial Recognition) to secure your "Vault" of financial data.

Processing: Biometric authentication is handled entirely by your device's operating system.

No Access: The App never has access to your actual face data or fingerprint data. We only receive a "Pass" or "Fail" signal from the operating system to unlock the App.

C. Crash Logs and Stability (Firebase)
We use Google Firebase Crashlytics to help us identify crashes and fix bugs.

Data Collected: If the App crashes, it may send an anonymous crash report containing technical details (e.g., "Crash occurred in DashboardScreen on iPhone 13, iOS 16").

Privacy: This data is anonymous and does not contain your financial tokens or personal identity.

D. Subscription Data (RevenueCat)
We use RevenueCat to manage optional premium subscriptions (e.g., "Pro Mode").

Data Collected: RevenueCat generates an Anonymous App User ID to track your subscription status (e.g., "Is this user a Pro member?").

Privacy: We do not link this ID to your name or email address unless you explicitly contact support and provide it.

3. Data Retention
Financial Data: Retained only as long as the App is installed on your device. Uninstalling the App instantly deletes all local data.

Crash Logs: Retained by Google Firebase for 90 days before being automatically deleted.

4. Third-Party Links
The App contains links to third-party websites (e.g., your Twitch Dashboard, Patreon Creator Page). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.

5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

6. Your Consent
By using the App, you consent to our Privacy Policy.
